######Real Time Collision Detection - Christer Ericson
The best book I have found on collision detection. There is so much content in this thing.
######[Two-Bit Coding](https://www.youtube.com/@two-bitcoding8018)
This man has helped no end with the collision stuff. Having a code example was massively useful in understanding how things work.
######Game Physics Engine Development - Ian Millington
This was good up until I realised it didn't actually cover 2d rigidbodies and it was all 3D.
######Physics for Game Developers - David M Bourg
This was the second attempt to find a good book book to replace GPED and this covered alot of the right stuff but there were alot of formulas that felt unnecessary but it was indepth.
