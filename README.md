###### [Real Time Collision Detection - Christer Ericson](https://amzn.eu/d/86DKd2p)
The best book I have found on collision detection. There is so much content in this thing.
###### [Two-Bit Coding](https://www.youtube.com/@two-bitcoding8018)
This man has helped no end with the collision stuff. Having a code example was massively useful in understanding how things work.

This was good up until I realised it didn't actually cover 2d rigidbodies and it was all 3D.

This was the second attempt to find a good book book to replace GPED and this covered alot of the right stuff but there were alot of formulas that felt unnecessary but it was indepth.
